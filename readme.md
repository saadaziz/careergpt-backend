# CareerGPT Backend

CareerGPT is a **FastAPI-based backend** hosted on DomainRacer (cPanel). It powers the CareerGPT UI by analyzing job titles with OpenAI and is structured for future growth (security, profiles, and body of knowledge).

---

## Features (Current)
- FastAPI backend running on cPanel (WSGI compatibility via custom adapter).
- Root endpoint (`/`) for health checks.
- `/logs` endpoint for **real-time log viewing** (auto-refresh, styled terminal view).
- Centralized logging to `stderr` (captured by cPanel).

---

## Planned Features / Roadmap
**Phase 1**  
- `/demo` POST endpoint for UI → backend integration.

**Phase 2**  
- Security layer (origin check or API token).  
- User profiles and JWT authentication.

**Phase 3**  
- Body of Knowledge (ChromaDB + embeddings) integration.  
- Admin dashboard for logs and analytics.

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development
1. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/careergpt-backend.git
   cd careergpt-backend
````

2. Create virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run locally:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

---

### Deployment (DomainRacer cPanel)

1. **Upload files** to application root (e.g., `/home/<username>/careergpt_dev/`).
2. **Create Python App** in cPanel:

   * Python version: 3.9.20
   * Application root: `careergpt_dev`
   * Startup file: `passenger_wsgi.py`
   * Entry point: `application`
3. **Install dependencies** via cPanel:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --user
   ```
4. **Set environment variables** (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) via cPanel.
5. **Restart App** and visit:

   * Health: `https://aurorahours.com/careergpt_dev/`
   * Logs: `https://aurorahours.com/careergpt_dev/logs`

---

## Development Notes

* All logs are written to `stderr` (captured by cPanel).
* `/logs` auto-refreshes every 5 seconds for debugging.
* Future phases will integrate authentication and ChromaDB-based BoK.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed development history.

## **3. Commit Commands (First Push)**

Run this in your local project folder:

```bash
# Initialize repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial FastAPI setup: WSGI adapter, logging system, and logs UI"

# Add remote (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/careergpt-backend.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
````

---

### **Next Steps**

* Confirm `logs` endpoint works in production.
* Begin Phase 1: Add `/demo` endpoint for UI → backend connection.
* Document `/demo` API spec in README.
